      'I firstly enjoyed something related to programming back when I was a kid, 9 or 10 years old. I already was into computers and games, and my good childhood friend found a program that could execute code in any app. We were spending hours upon hours trying to make it perform certain action in games to cheat our way through otherwise tedious grinds. Program itself was very basic and simple - for example, it could identify a color of a chosen pixel and based on that press some key or move or click a mouse. But in certain games it was more than sufficient to automate processes that could last several hours.',
      'As my passion for programs and games never went away, gradually my skills of automating processes improved. A while later I began to add scripts, macros and such.',
      'My first experience of web-design was way later, when I was studying in uni. During my second year there we had a course of Information Science, where the main task was to build a simple website using only HTML and CSS. We were free to choose the thematics and design, requirements were quite vague. I ended up created a news resource with several pages, image maps (to navigate users to the correct pages based on the image coords they clicked), tables (to store images, text and date of the news) and such. Also I talked my way in to use a little bit of jQuery to add drop-down menus!',

      "After finishing unversity I spent a couple of years trying different things as a freelancer. They weren't related to programming but it was the perfect years to try new things out. Later on I joined a really small Start-up called Gamerthings', 'At Gamerthings, generally speaking, our goal was to start with an E-commerce platform that would eventually grow to social networks and other services. For almost the whole course of me being there I was a sole programmer. Prior to this moment I hadn't had much experience and hadn't worked with the project of this scale. During the development we weren't in a hurry and we valued quality, so I was able to learn via courses and internet resources to then implement what I learned in the project.",
      "It was an amazing experience and I am so grateful that it went exactly like that. Because I was able to practice a lot, never falling into so-called tutorial hell, and I was able to make mistakes, and then correct them. Now I am aware of many pitfalls that I would never know if I went from courses to some kind of team with a supervisor. I just wouldn't be on a level to make wronmg decisions to witness the consequences.",
      "After developing the website for a little more than a year the family financial situation became tricky and I had to move on. It would be unethical for me to use the work I've done for my portfolio, since the Gamerthings project was never frozen nor abandoned. That's why I decided to create Loomhub. And right now I am open to new ideas and opportunities.",
